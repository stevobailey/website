As the title says, I've completed one semester of graduate school. 
It's been quite the learning experience. 
For the most part, the math and science are not hard to grasp. 
The real difficulty has been in finding the time to work on class projects and research without cramming all my work into a few days and nights. 
However, I'll be spending all winter break on self improvement, time management, and organizational skills. 
In the meantime, why don't you check out |projects.htm|one of my class projects| I just added?
