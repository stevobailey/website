Graduate school takes an immense amount of discipline to manage a social life, numerous research projects, class projects, and a personal life.
Time management, organization, and finding your purpose in life all boil down to clearly defining divisions. 

For example, effective time management requires blocking time for specific activities like work or play. 
Working 100% of the time partitioned for work allows you to be focused on the task at hand. 
Having designated playtime gives you a reward to look forward to. 
Divide your time beforehand so you know what to expect. 
When the unexpected happens, as it inevitably will, do your best to plan around it.
When you have time to work, accomplish something in that time. 
Picking up a task where you left off requires the overhead of getting your mind back in the right mindset. 

Organization requires similar high-level divisions early on. 
Think of your home or office as a hierarchy of your life and your tasks. 
At the top level are large, clearly defined separations in your life. 
For example, at the office, you can divide your tasks into bins like paperwork, mail, creative work, etc. 
At home, your life may be cooking, cleaning, laundry, books, etc. 
These divisions belong in different, ideally non-overlapping, spaces. 
At work, dedicate a shelf for paperwork and a different one for creative ideas. 
At home, each room already provides nice separations for your life's tasks. 
Once the different areas are well defined, maintaining them is effortless and natural. 

Finally, your goals and aspirations must be clearly defined up front if you hope to achieve them. 
How do you know if what you're doing will get you where you want to go if you don't know where you want to go?"
