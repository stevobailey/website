It's not perfect, but it's up and running! 
It's taken many months of learning HTML, CSS, Javascript, JSON, JQuery, and GIMP to put this thing together. 
I probably restarted the entire thing about 3 times now. 
Nevertheless, I have big plans for the site! 
Too bad grad school tends to eat up every available hour I have. 
Curious about what I spend all my time doing? 
Check out the |projects.htm|projects| page! 
I'm doing plenty of exciting things at UC Berkeley!
