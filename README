TODO:
=====================
- make sure to correctly format blog entry text, like replace quotes with actual quotes (&quot; or &ldquo;/&rdquo;)
- replace scp with rsync when copying over files (see http://www-inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/setup.html#student_page)
- can use PHP on instructional server (not login server)
    - push server_view/ to cory.eecs.berkeley.edu (need a redirect from regular eecs.berkeley.edu then)
    - make sure to change permissions of all files copied over
    - end files with .php
    - access website from inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~stevo.bailey

Organization and ideas:
-----------------------

Website organization:
=====================

Pages:
- blog/home
    - standard blog style
    - about 10 entries per page, with next and previous buttons
    - include tags and searching features
    - optional: sorting feature
    - a lot these things will need to be done client or server side, not just pre-publication
    - content: 
        - interesting technology?
        - space news
- projects
    - similar format to blog?
    - make this the primary homepage?
    - list of projects, with a "featured" project again
    - sub-pages for each individual project
- publications
    - ideally searchable and sortable
    - list format or tabular?
- about
    - short and sweet


Formatting and style:
- much simpler than it currently is
- something space related, since I'd like to devote my life to space stuff from now on


documents/
    - project documents
scripts/
    - client-side scripts (like CSS, Javascript, etc)
images/
    - only necessary ones
.html files
    - pages



Repo organization:
==================

- Goal: separate formatting from content
- script creation of actual webpages, but make it easy to alter/understand later

server_view/
    - see website organization above
    - copied over to server, but not saved in repo
    - generated from scripts
scripts/
    - creation scripts (perl/python/whatever)
    - server-side script templates (HTML, CSS, etc)
data/
    - blog posts, project information, etc.
Makefile
    - generate server_view/ files and folders
    - copy server view to server
