Feedback helps stabilize linear systems, but it can also help stabilize your life. 

To ensure that your life is going in the direction you desire, spend a few hours each week reviewing the previous week. 
Start by writing down what you did. 
Be sure to note what you did well, as these positive reinforcements will promote more positive actions. 
Also note what you could improve on, and suggest ways to actually improve on these during the coming week. 
If all goes well, you can turn one week’s disappointments into the next week’s successes. 

I’ve just started enacting this feedback/review process in my own life, and I’ve already found a new sense of flow. 
My life seems to drift less. 
During the week, my thoughts are only on the various tasks I have to perform. 
However, my Sunday review process brings my focus back to my goals and projects. 
I make sure that my previous week’s tasks were all in line with my goals, and I establish a list of tasks for the coming week so that my mind can focus on work alone. 
I can also see how this feedback loop ensures that I’m always improving my life. 
Successes repeat themselves, and failures almost never happen twice. 

So take some time to reflect on your life. 
The feedback may be just what you need to upgrade yourself to a higher level of living.
